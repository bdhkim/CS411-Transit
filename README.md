# BCS411 BU Mapper Project
this is the code that we looked during our faculty lecture on dogfooding. Note that to run this project, node_modules must be installed via `npm install` in TWO different places. One in the default direcotry where there is package.json AND within the app folder that contains another package.json file.

## Passport
This branch is set up for authentication using Passport.js

## Running
To run, first clone the repo and install the Node componenets. Start mongoDB with `mongod`, then run the app with `npm start`.
